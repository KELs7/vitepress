## Xian 
***[ sh ee - ah n ]***


*An immortal or mythical being from the Taoist pantheon.* 

## Introduction to Xian

Xian is a pioneering blockchain project that melds innovation with accessibility in decentralized technology. Combining the speed and robustness of CometBFT consensus with the simplicity and elegance of Python, Xian offers a secure, scalable, and developer-friendly platform.

## Why Xian?

- **Developer Accessibility:** Python is the biggest developer community in the world and it’s still growing every year. But it’s weird because there is no blockchain that allows for native python smart contracts. That’s exactly what we introduce.
- **Accessibility and Speed:** Battle-tested consensus engine written in Go to be fast and Smart contract engine written in Python to allow for native Python contracts that are extremely simple / easy to write.
- **Community Driven Governance:** Our DAO-based governance model ensures community-driven, transparent decision-making, giving stakeholders a voice in the project's direction.
