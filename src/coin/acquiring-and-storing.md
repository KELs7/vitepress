# Acquiring and Storing

The Xian ecosystem revolves around its native coin **$XIAN**, which powers transactions, governance, and smart-contract execution.  
Below is a *fixed guide (17 Jun 2025)* on how to obtain and safeguard $XIAN, reflecting the resources and links published on the official site.

## **Acquiring $XIAN**

| Method | Where | Details |
|--------|-------|---------|
| **On-chain DEX (native token)** | **SNAKexchange** – [`XIAN/USDC` pair](https://snakexchange.org/pairs/) | Trade directly on the Xian Layer-1; liquidity is denominated in native $XIAN. |
| **Bridged token (Solana)** | **Raydium** – [Swap link](https://raydium.io/swap/?inputMint=sol&outputMint=GnaXkbmMV1zGK6bRCQnM9Jd6Jv2Hjw5b2PFVBaKEE5At) | Purchase wrapped $XIAN on Solana, then bridge it to Xian for on-chain use. |
| **Centralized exchange** | **Dex-Trade** – [`XIAN/USDT` pair](https://dex-trade.com/spot/trading/XIAN_USDT) | Buy $XIAN on a CEX using USDT; withdraw to your Xian wallet for native staking or dApps. |
| **Bridge existing assets** | **Xian Bridge** – <https://bridge.xian.org> | Move SOL, USDC, or bridged $XIAN between Solana and the Xian mainnet. |
| **Earn by participating** | • Provide liquidity or farm on SNAKexchange (100 %+ APR farms).<br>• Deploy dApps and collect 68 % of gas fees.<br>• Contribute to DAO bounties and governance. |
| **Faucets** | • [Mainnet faucet](https://xian-faucet-mainnet.poc.workers.dev/)<br>• [Testnet faucet](https://xian-faucet.poc.workers.dev/) | Small starter amounts for testing and development. |

> **Native vs Bridged:** Stats shown on <xian.org> (price, market cap, circulating supply) refer to the **native token on Xian**. Wrapped $XIAN on Solana may display different metrics on third-party trackers.

## **Best-Practice Security Checklist**

1. **Back up your seed phrase** offline (paper or encrypted hardware). Xian Wallet cannot recover lost keys.  
2. **Verify URLs** – Only install the wallet from the Chrome Web Store link above and interact with dApps you trust.  
3. **Keep software current** – Update Chrome *and* the Xian Wallet to patch vulnerabilities.  
4. **Use hardware wallets for large holdings** – Ledger/Trezor support is planned; until then, store high-value keys on air-gapped devices.  
5. **Review contract code** before approving transactions, especially for new tokens—remember that community-created tokens are *not* endorsed by the core team.
