# Economics of the Coin

The Xian blockchain introduces a unique economic model centered around its native coin, with a **maximum supply of 111 ,111 ,111 $XIAN** minted at genesis.  
What follows is a **fixed snapshot (17 Jun 2025)** of how that supply is currently allocated; it will **not be updated further in this document**.  
The ≈ 937.258 $XIAN difference between the maximum supply and the table below has already been *permanently burned* by the protocol’s 1 % gas-burn mechanic.

## **Current Supply Allocation**

| Allocation | Tokens | % of Max* |
|------------|------------------|-----------|
| **Validator DAO Treasury** | 48 409 053.545 | 43.57 % |
| **Validator DAO Vesting**  | 38 022 158.645 | 34.22 % |
| **Team Locker**            | 5 364 311.556  | 4.83 % |
| **Team Vesting**           | 4 243 545.003  | 3.82 % |
| **Circulating (Live)**     | 15 071 104.993 | 13.56 % |
| **Total in Existence**     | **111 110 173.742** | 99.16 % |
| **Burned so far**          | **≈ 937.258** | 0.84 % |
| **Maximum Supply**         | **111 111 111** | 100 % |

\*Percentages rounded to two decimals.

### Notes on Allocation

* **Validator DAO** (Treasury + Vesting) controls ≈ 77.8 % of supply to fund governance and ecosystem growth.  
* **Team tokens** are split between a locked tranche and a vesting schedule, aligning incentives with network success.  
* **Circulating supply** starts at ~13.6 % and will decrease gradually as ongoing burns outpace fresh unlocks.

## **Transaction Fees (Stamps)**

Every transaction pays a *stamp* fee that is automatically divided:

* **68 %** → Contract developer  
* **30 %** → Validators  
* **1 %**  → Burn (deflationary)  
* **1 %**  → Foundation wallet  

All ratios can be modified through on-chain validator governance.

### Incentive Alignment

* **Developers** earn recurring revenue, encouraging innovative, high-quality dApps.  
* **Validators** secure the chain and are compensated in native $XIAN.  
* **Burns** create long-term deflationary pressure as network usage grows.  
* **Foundation** funding supports tooling, marketing, and grants—fueling further adoption.
