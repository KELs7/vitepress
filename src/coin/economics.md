# Economics of the Coin

The Xian blockchain introduces a unique economic model centered around its native coin, with a total supply of `111,111,111` coins that are initially minted. This finite supply, along with a detailed distribution strategy and a transaction fee mechanism designed for fairness and sustainability, forms the backbone of Xian's economic ecosystem. Here, we break down the economics of the coin, including its distribution, the role of transaction fees (stamps), and the mechanisms in place to ensure long-term viability and deflationary pressure.

## **Initial Coin Distribution**

The distribution of the initial coin supply was carefully structured to align with the long-term goals of the Xian project and ensure a balanced allocation among stakeholders:

* **Founding Private Sale (5%)**: A portion of the coins was sold in a founding private sale, allowing early supporters and strategic partners to participate in the project's growth from its inception.
* **Public Sale (40%)**: The largest share of the coins were allocated for the public sale, democratizing access to the coins and ensuring a wide distribution among the community.
* **Team Allocation (20%)**: A total of 20% of the coins were allocated to the team, with 15% released over 5 years to incentivize long-term commitment and 5% provided upfront as a reward for their early contributions to the project.
* **DAO (35%)**: 35% of the total supply was allocated to the DAO, funding community-driven development, governance initiatives, and other projects beneficial to the Xian ecosystem.

This distribution strategy ensures that the Xian project is supported by a diverse group of stakeholders, including the project team, its community, and investors, all of whom play a critical role in the platform's development and governance.

## **Transaction Fees (Stamps)**

When a transaction is executed, the fees (also called "stamps") are distributed as follows:

* 68% to the contract developer that wrote the executed contract
* 30% to validators (split evenly among active validators)
* 1% burned (reducing total supply)
* 1% to foundation wallet

These percentages can be adjusted through validator governance votes.

This incentivizes:
* High-quality contract development through developer rewards
* Network security through validator rewards  
* Long-term value through deflationary burning
* Ecosystem development through foundation funding
