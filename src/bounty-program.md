# Xian Bounty Program: Build the Future

## **Introduction**

The Xian Blockchain ecosystem is expanding, and we need **builders** to develop core infrastructure that will drive adoption. To accelerate this, we’re launching the **Xian Bounty Program**, a **one-time rewards initiative** where developers can earn up to **1 million XIAN** for completing high-impact projects and become major stakeholders on the Xian Network.

## **💡 Bounty Evaluation & Partial Rewards**

To encourage participation, partial rewards may be issued based on project quality, completeness, and usability.

### **Evaluation Criteria:**

- ✅ **Full Functionality & Deployment** (Highest rewards for live, production-ready platforms)
- ✅ **Security & Code Quality** (Code must follow best practices and pass review)
- ✅ **Adoption & Usage** (Projects that demonstrate real on-chain activity receive higher payouts)
- ✅ **Innovative Features** (Additional points for advanced implementations and improvements)

🚨 **Minimum Viable Products (MVPs) and partially completed projects may qualify for a fraction of the bounty reward, subject to community and team review.**

💬 Q: What if multiple developers work on the same project?
The bounty goes to the best, most complete, and first fully deployed solution. However, we may reward other implementations based on their quality, uniqueness, and impact. If multiple projects are valuable, the bounty may be distributed proportionally.

### **Vesting Schedule:**

- 40% of the bounty is **paid out on delivery**
- 60% of the bounty is **paid out over 1 year** in **linear vesting**.


- Early termination of vesting may occur if the project becomes inactive or abandoned.
